This program basically fakes the unique ID which are created on each new Windows installation, the project is under MIT license and for sale, there will never be a public source visible here on GitHub - simply to avoid Microsoft changes that internally to block this. <br /> 

This works in an abstract layer similar like the popular XPrivacy XPosed extension for Android but just for Windows 10. <br />

It can fake:
* localId
* Windows deviceClass 
* Blocking/NXProcessorSupport (CPU detection)
* NXDriverResult (NX support)
* SSE2ProcessorSupport 
* IsMDMEnrolled 
* TelemetryLevel 
* DeviceForm 
* DigitizerSupport 
* CanCollectCoreTelemetry
* CanCollectHeartbeats 
* CanCollectAnyTelemetry 
* TransitionFromEverythingOff
* CanAddMsaToMsTelemetry 
* CanPerformTraceEscalations 
* CanPerformDiagnosticEscalations 
* LastConntectivityLossTime 

The idea behind is similar like the Tor Browser, to not hide but to get people the same fingerprint so that the [telemetry collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/basic-level-windows-diagnostic-events-and-fields) would be useless.


Interested people can contact me to get a price and a link to the source and the program.
