# Microsoft localId faker

This program basically fakes the unique ID which are created on each new Windows installation, the project is under MIT license and for sale, there will never be a public source visible here on GitHub - simply to avoid Microsoft changes that internally to block this. <br /> 

This works in an abstract layer similar like the popular XPrivacy XPosed extension for Android but just for Windows 10. <br />

It can fake:
* localId
* Windows deviceClass 
* Blocking/NXProcessorSupport (CPU detection)
* NXDriverResult (NX support)
* SSE2ProcessorSupport 
* IsMDMEnrolled 
* TelemetryLevel 
* DeviceForm 
* DigitizerSupport 
* CanCollectCoreTelemetry
* CanCollectHeartbeats 
* CanCollectAnyTelemetry 
* TransitionFromEverythingOff
* CanAddMsaToMsTelemetry 
* CanPerformTraceEscalations 
* CanPerformDiagnosticEscalations 
* LastConntectivityLossTime 

The idea behind is similar like the Tor Browser, to not hide but to get people the same fingerprint so that the [telemetry collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/basic-level-windows-diagnostic-events-and-fields) would be useless.
